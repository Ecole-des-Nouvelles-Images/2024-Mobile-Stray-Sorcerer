## Team

This project was made in roughly a month, with one week from conception to 3 weeks of production time.

## Development
Although the project is considered finished and has been reviewed as part of our curriculum, we may fix bugs, polish any part needed and even introduce new features based on the original idea.
We invite anyone testing the project to open an **[issue ticket](https://github.com/Ecole-des-Nouvelles-Images/Mobile-Stray-Sorcerer/issues/new/choose)** if you find a bug or have a suggestion !
Thanks for your interest !
<br><br>

## Release
This game is designed for mobile devices in mind. An `.apk` file is available in the **[Release](https://github.com/Ecole-des-Nouvelles-Images/Mobile-Stray-Sorcerer/releases)** section, Android users may install it manually when uploaded to their devices in order to play.<br>
This application should be compatible starting Android version 5.1 but device requirements are still being improved.
